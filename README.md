## Controls

Use your keyboard arrow keys to move and spacebar to shoot, R for new random seed, F for FPS to console.

## Info

WIP, not what I intended it to be. It's become a bit of a problem child or burden because I just don't feel the original plan I wrote up for it anymore. I am not sure I even want to continue with the idea, rather just cap it off at some point of reasonable completion.

The game that inspired this: https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12116

`res.h` is loaded with 4x 1920x~1080 source images listed in attributions which I intend to use
to re-create that swirling pattern in the original game.
