## Controls

Uses mouse by default,  right click to toggle Keyboard/Mouse control.

KEYBOARD: arrow keys to move and spacebar to shoot, R for new random seed, F for FPS to console.

## Info

WIP, not what I intended it to be. It seems to run pretty well on the RPI 4B+ though which is pretty cool but the cubes2_arm binary in the source repo is out of date.

The game that inspired this: https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12116

`res.h` is loaded with 4x 1920x~1080 source images listed in attributions which I intend to use
to re-create that swirling pattern in the original game.
